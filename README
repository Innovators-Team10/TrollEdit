TrollEdit is a Qt based text editor developed by students at Slovak University of Technology.

The main goal of the project is to teach students open source deveopmnet and team management.
TrollEdit itself is an experiment to utilize full AST code analysis during writing of code.
This can have benefits in various common tasks such as moving blocks of code, syntax checking,
syntax highlighting etc.

This repository contains a fork of the project which I modified to use CMake based build system 
instead of the default qmake. Other modifications include statically linked in lpeg and reordered
project file structure.
